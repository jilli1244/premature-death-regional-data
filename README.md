# Comparing Regional Data
This repository was produced for English 105 Unit 3 Project at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
## About
This data repository is comparing Premature deaths, Health, Teen births, Child poverty, and Primary care physicians by Region.

This repository was created to compile the given mass data of Public County Health into a more digesible dataset.

- Provides viewers with data comparing factors by region (i.e Premature deaths and Teen births by Region) 
- Can be used to study regional data
- Creates a subset of data that compare different aspects of health data in the years 2014-2015

## Data Source
The data for this repository is from the Public County Health Data from the years 2014-2015 taken from Davis Library Research Hub at UNC Chapel Hill.
This raw data is a large .csv file and can be found under the "data" tab.

In this file you will be able to find all original information about the found health data.

## What is in this Repository?

This repository has a Python Notebook detailing the process of creating a new subset of data from the original large file. The raw data was made into a more concise subset of data through the use of Python in a Colab Notebook.

- The Original dataset can be found in the data file named "CountyHealthData2014-2015.csv"
- The created subset of data can be found in the data file named "Filtered Dataset.csv"
- The Python Notebook containing the steps on how to create a new subset of data from the original data.


## Users
This repository contains instructions on how to use Python and its pandas package to create new subsets from the data to allow for easier understanding and comparison of the data.

By having access to this repository and its condensed datasets, viewers can expand the data if needed using the original data .csv file and the knowledge learned from this repository to conduct their own analysis of the dataset. 
## What's the Next Step?
1. After looking at the ReadMe page, look at the original dataset "CountyHealthData2014-2015.csv" file under the data tab.
2. To manufacture a similar process, download this data and find the "Procedural_Overview.ipynb" tab with the steps to create a new subset of data.
    - If you would like to make a similar dataset with different variables, follow the steps and simply change the information you wish to compare.
